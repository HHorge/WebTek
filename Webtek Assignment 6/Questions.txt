1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
    Because the computer uses binary to store information, float numbers cannot be stored 100%
    accurately in decimal. Therefore 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3000000000000004 and not 3. 
2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
    The method attribute specifies how to send the form-data. In the index.html method="post" is used
    meaning the form-data is sent as HTTP post transaction.
3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET ?
    Because method="get" sends the form-data as URL variables.
4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or Javascript?
    For security reasons you also want to validate data on your server. Local validation 
    only helps with correct wrong input, but not the security aspect.
5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
    When you're expecting a longer piece of text. For a name or short string you'd use
    input, for questions like the ones asked here it would be more appropriate with textarea.
