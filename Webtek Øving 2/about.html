      <li> What does the server in the client server architecture do?</li>
      <p>The server stores the information, so that it's available for the clients to download.</p>
      <li>What does the client do?</li>

        Comparable to a phone number.</p>
      <li>What is DNS?</li>
      <p>Domain Name Service is a sort of phonebook, but instead of connecting phone numbers to names, it connects domain
        names to IP addresses.<br> Making sure that the client entering a domain name gets sent to the right server (unique
        IP address). </p>
      <li>What is the difference between the Internet and WWW?</li>
      <p>The Internet is a massive network of computers, that allows any computers connected to the same network communicate
        with each other.
        <br>There are a lot of different types of connections on the Internet, the World Wide Web being one of them. <br>The
        WWW is the part of the Internet that contains all websites. </p>
